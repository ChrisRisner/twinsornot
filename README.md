# twinsornot
Source code for www.twinsornot.net v1

Notes: This is the version as it was launched. Again, this was a 4 hours project so there isn't much there. Key point is the home controller where we call the Face APIs and some JavaScript at the _Layout.cshtml handling the uploads and returned data. Most of everything else is just a vanilla ASP.Net MVC app out of Visual Studio. Soon we will be fully revamping the site so this is just for reference.

Remember you will need your own Face API key: http://www.projectoxford.ai/face and some details about how it was built are available here: http://www.matvelloso.com/2015/06/08/and-because-we-love-open-source/ 

Thanks!
