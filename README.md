Source code for www.twinsornot.net v1

Notes: This is the version as it was launched. Again, this was a 4 hours project so there isn't much there. Key point is the home controller where we call the Face APIs and some JavaScript at the _Layout.cshtml handling the uploads and returned data. Most of everything else is just a vanilla ASP.Net MVC app out of Visual Studio. Soon we will be fully revamping the site so this is just for reference.

Thanks!
